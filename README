I'm finally pushing my dotfiles up to git!

This is mainly for me to solve the headaches I currently have with working on multiple machines. My .vimrc looks different on pretty much every machine I log in to.

I thought a lot about which was the best way to go about version controlling this. Do I really want a .git folder in my homedir? After trying several approaches using bash scripts, makefiles, and rakefiles, I emulated https://github.com/rtomayko/dotfiles. The main reason I chose this approach was to be able to push things like .ssh/authorized_keys without pushing or disrupting .ssh/known_hosts.

When using this approach, be sure to add a "*" line to ~/.git/info/exclude file. Otherwise, git status will drive you nuts. You'll also need to use `git add -f` to add new files moving forward.

Feel free to grab anything from here that you find useful. I'd love to hear feedback from anyone!
